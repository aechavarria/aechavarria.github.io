    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p> Hello! My name is Alicia Echavarria. I'm currently a junior attending KIPP NYC College Prep. 
    I am very passionate about both science and performing arts. In my spare time, I dance, sing, and write fictional stories. 
    Aside from my artistic personality, I aspire to seek a career in pathology. My goal is to attend my dream school, Johns Hopkins
    University and double major in both biology and creative writing.</p>
